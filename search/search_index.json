The overall  system includes a sound detection board and a brightness detection board, each responsible for sensing environmental triggers such as claps or when it's night time. When either sensor detects activity, it sends a signal to a central control board, which processes the inputs and determines whether to activate or deactivate the lighting.  The light board then receives the control signal and turns the light on or off accordingly, and also spins continously on a motor, which stops when a signal is received from the brightness or sound detection boards. This provides an efficient, user-friendly, and contactless lighting solution ideal for homes, offices, or other spaces.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"#team-members-datasheet-links","title":"Team Members Datasheet links","text":"Team Member Ind Datasheet Links Sam Burns suburns.github.io Arianna Lazaritt alazaritt.github.io Sam Mangus SamMangus.github.io","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"#final-image-of-project","title":"Final Image of Project","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"02-Team-Organization/","title":"Team Organization","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"02-Team-Organization/#team-charter","title":"Team Charter","text":"<p>Our team is working to develop a solution that simplifies daily actions through a smart, hands-free lighting system.

She frequently finds herself in positions where she cannot easily reach a switch on a wall, leading her to rely on a system that responds quickly and reliably to a simple sound cue such as a clap or short vocal signal. She comes home one day, her hands full with grocery bags. By simply whistling once, she activates the light in her dark kitchen, allowing her to see her counterspace to know where to put her things. The light stays on when the door slams shut behind her, as it wasn't loud enough to trigger the light again. The quick response of the light allows her to see the items in the room and safely navigate around the space to start putting her things away.</p> <p>User Case #2: Bill</p> <p>Bill has limited mobility and is in a wheelchair, however, the lightswitch in his workshop is on the other end of the room and can take him a while to reach. He claps his hands upon entering the room to trigger the lights, letting him trigger the audio response of the lights. Bill frequently works with louder machines in his workshop, but the threshold at which the light is set to trigger at does not pick up these noises, allowing his work area to remain lit and keep him safe. One day he enters the workshop, clapping his hands as usualto turn the lights on. It is during the day, and the natural light that enters the room is detected by the system and the lights remain off to conserve energy. However, Bill needs more than just the natural light to see his work, so he uses an override button to turn the lights on, regardless of the lighting already in the room.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"04-Product-Requirements/#aspects","title":"Aspects","text":"<p>The new product design will be based on that of typical sound-activated automatic lighting systems with improvements based on the following requirements.

The Sound Board and Night Board each handle their own sensing, convert those readings into simple high/low signals, and send only the analyzed data to the Control Board. This allows us to reduce computation within the Control Board and to avoid noise-prone analog communication lines. Similarly, the Control Board software was structured to receive inputs first, then make decisions, and then trigger outputs such as stopping the motor or activating the light. Each board operates on a continuous loop to be able to continuously read, update, and analyze data being detected from the sensors. The use of decision blocks, object flows, and separate columns in the diagram reflects a structured, modular software approach where each board behaves independently yet contributes to the larger system logic. It provides a simple, straightforward, and effective solution for coordinating sensor inputs and controlling the lighting behavior based on real-time environmental conditions.</p>"},{"location":"07-Software%20Design/#how-it-meets-product-requirements","title":"How it Meets Product Requirements","text":"<p>As seen in the figure below, each subsystem was designed to support product requirements through a modular sensing, decision, and output workflow. The sensor boards continuously monitor environmental data and send high/low signals to the control board, ensuring hands-free operation and automatic responses to triggers with minimal user involvement. The threshold based structure of our sensors minimizes false positives and ensures quick response times. This directly supports our aforementioned requirements for efficiency, reliability, and user convenience. The control board evaluates sensor data and user settings before acting, ensuring the motor only stops and the light only turns on when both darkness and sound are detected, fulfilling needs for energy conservation. By isolating sensing, control, and output functions, the software becomes easier to maintain and more robust under varying conditions, as well as safer for continuous operation. The use of digital communication between boards enhances usability, simplifies manufacturing and testing, and ensures the system functions consistently. Overall, the software structure meets key requirements for safety, usability, reliability, and hands-free automation across the product\u2019s full operating conditions.</p>"},{"location":"07-Software%20Design/#version-20","title":"Version 2.0","text":"<p>If we were to develop a second version of the software design, several improvements could be implemented by revisiting key components of the software and hardware.  One of the most significant limitations of the current design is that each sensor board outputs only a simple high/low digital signal to the control board. While doing so simplifies communication and reduces noise issues, it also restricts the software\u2019s ability to interpret sensor data or adapt its behavior based on environmental variation. By adding support for analog signal communication, the software could dynamically adjust thresholds and better differentiate between background noise and intentional triggers. It would improve sound detection reliability and reduce reliance on fixed thresholds, which would be more difficult to tune for different environments and may not perform as reliably.</p> <p>The motor control section could also benefit from a more advanced motor driver with built-in current sensing, thermal shutdown, and improved flyback protection to protect electronics and extend the product's lifespan. Feedback mechanisms could also be added to allow software to detect jams, overloads, or unsafe conditions. This would enhance safety, enable smarter control, and make the device more robust.</p> <p>Overall, Version 2.0 of the system would benefit from hardware upgrades that give the software more information, more control, and more efficiency. By improving sensor interfaces, motor control hardware, and communication methods, the software could evolve from a basic threshold-driven approach into a more intelligent and adaptive design that better supports long-term reliability and performance. </p>"},{"location":"08-Resources/","title":"08 Resources","text":""},{"location":"08-Resources/#final-image-of-team-system","title":"Final Image of Team System","text":""},{"location":"08-Resources/#cad-files","title":"CAD Files","text":"<p>Zipped CAD files for concepts created during design ideation can be found here.</p> <p>If you have videos documenting your final system working, upload them to youtube and embed the resulting html directly in your markdown document.</p>"},{"location":"09-Reflection/","title":"Reflection","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"09-Reflection/#lessons-learned","title":"Lessons Learned","text":"<p>As a team we quickly learned how to work together and finish each other's work due to our different schedules.

Within each group, we identified the top features that would best fit the main requirement of each group. We also included supporting features that would help enhance the overall user experience and functionality of the project.

These needs were similarly ranked, and the top-ranked features were then recombined into three distinct product concepts, with unused features saved in a separate location for documentation and possible future reference. Each product concept emphasized different features to see which combinations of them would best optimize user needs and functionality. This process helped us balance creativity with structure, ensuring that our final concepts were innovative while remaining user-driven.</p>"}]}
