The target is to maintain global dominance in the wireless earphone market, drive up AirPod sales to 100 million+ units sold with a 60% global market share in 2021 and expand the user base more towards the luxury, professional, and fitness segments. We believe that adding smart interactions and adaptive audio filters alone will already expand our user base by 15%. With the new generation AirPods we aim to match at least the sound quality of our main competitor, the Sony WF-1000XM3, and include Active Noise Canceling that is also featured in Mifo, House of Marley, Bose, and Amazon Echo products. We will also obtain IPX4 sweat-resistant rating equal to Bose, House of Marley, and Amazon Echo earbuds, and aim to extend our range of colors, as seen in Urbanista and Jabra\u2019s lifestyle products.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"04-Product-Requirements/#stakeholders","title":"Stakeholders","text":"<ul> <li>Target group High-income upper-class professionals between the age of 20 and 45.
