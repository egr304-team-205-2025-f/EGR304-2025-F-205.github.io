## Project Objective

This project aims to develop a sound-actuated automatic lighting system that will respond to specific audio cues to turn lights on and off. Using audio detection will create a convenient hands-free experience for users, allowing for more enhanced lighting across various environments, such as homes, offices, and other workspaces. It will also feature brightness detection to keep the light off if the area is already bright, improving energy efficiency while maintaining effectiveness and simplicity. The system also incorporates a rotating motorized platform on the light board that continuously scans the surrounding area until a valid signal is received, at which point the motor stops and the light activates in a fixed direction. It will be designed to be easy to install and interact with, allowing users with limited technical experience to operate and benefit from the product.

## Stakeholders

- **Primary Users** Individuals in environments where hands-free lighting solutions would improve accessibility and convenience.
- **Users With Mobility Limitations** Users who may not be able to reach or activate standard light switches due to physical limitations.
- **Installers** Those who install, set up, or troubleshoot the device. The device should remain relatively simple and user friendly for configuration purposes.
- **Technical Support** Team assiting users with any issues that may be encountered.
- **Marketing and Retailers** Able to cater the product to a wide range of audiences for various different solutions. 


## Use Cases

**User Case #1: Emily**

Emily is a multitasking parent who often enters dim hallways or rooms with her hands full, carrying groceries, laundry, or managing her kids. She frequently finds herself in positions where she cannot easily reach a switch on a wall, leading her to rely on a system that responds quickly and reliably to a simple sound cue such as a clap or short vocal signal. She comes home one day, her hands full with grocery bags. By simply whistling once, she activates the light in her dark kitchen, allowing her to see her counterspace to know where to put her things. The light stays on when the door slams shut behind her, as it wasn't loud enough to trigger the light again. The quick response of the light allows her to see the items in the room and safely navigate around the space to start putting her things away.

**User Case #2: Bill**

Bill has limited mobility and is in a wheelchair, however, the lightswitch in his workshop is on the other end of the room and can take him a while to reach. He claps his hands upon entering the room to trigger the lights, letting him trigger the audio response of the lights. Bill frequently works with louder machines in his workshop, but the threshold at which the light is set to trigger at does not pick up these noises, allowing his work area to remain lit and keep him safe. One day he enters the workshop, clapping his hands as usualto turn the lights on. It is during the day, and the natural light that enters the room is detected by the system and the lights remain off to conserve energy. However, Bill needs more than just the natural light to see his work, so he uses an override button to turn the lights on, regardless of the lighting already in the room.

## Aspects

The new product design will be based on that of typical sound-activated automatic lighting systems with improvements based on the following requirements. The **P1 - P10** is the "code" to indicate the priority of the requirement, from low to high.

 **Product Design**

   * 1.1 The product shall be visually easy to distinguish from existing lighting systems as well as main competitors which can be various motion activated lights that are battery powered. (P10)
   * 1.2 The product shall be easy to recognize as a high quality and highly practical lighting solution given its many was to mount it on a wide range of surfaces. (P10)
   * 1.3 The product shall avoid styling elements from our other lighting solutions such as the thin exterior plastic that often makes the product feel very cheap. (P8)
   * 1.4 The product shall have simple design with having mechanical buttons while keeping the various mounting solutions on the back of the product. (P8)

  
 **Functionality**

   * 2.1 The product shall incorporate external buttons for immediate controll. (P10)
   * 2.2 The product shall offer a microphone looking for specific audio inputs to tricker the light. (P10)
   * 2.3 The product shall have a customizable mounting system to accommodate various mounting systems. (P9)
   * 2.4 The product shall have a rechargeable battery system. (P10)
   * 2.5 The product shall turn off after a set period which can be adjusted by the user. (P5)



## Requirement Criteria Specifications

* 1.1.1 - Utalize Type-C charging for universal use with an onboard power regulator to 5.0 V.
* 1.1.2 - Rechargable lithim ion battery with a minimum capacity of 10,000 mHa.
* 1.1.3 - Tactile pull buttons, with clear graphics demontrating what the buttons are used for.
* 1.2.1 - Built in magnets on adjustable "legs" of the product.
* 1.2.2 - Various adaptors for mounting to different surfaces.  

## Open Questions

* Can we move towards a recyclable and repairable product, for example, with ZIF connectors and glue-free assembly?
* Can we improve on lighting a room from a single sorce?
* Can we create a cost effective product that is also practical and durable?
