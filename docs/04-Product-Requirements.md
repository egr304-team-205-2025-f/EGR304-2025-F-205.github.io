## Project Objective

This project aims to develop a sound-actuated automatic lighting system that will respond to specific audio cues to turn lights on and off. Using audio detection will create a convenient hands-free experience for users, allowing for more enhanced lighting across various environments, such as homes, offices, and other workspaces. By using a sound-responsive system, the project will improve energy efficiency while maintaining effectiveness and simplicity. It will be designed to be easy to install and interact with, allowing users with limited technical experience to operate and benefit from the product.

## Stakeholders

- **Target group** Individuals in environments where hands-free lighting solutions would improve accessibility and convenience.
- **Target purchaser** Organizations or individuals wanting practical, energy efficient lighting solutions that will enhance user experience.
- **Customer service** Provides straightforward and timely responses to support troubleshooting solutions to users
- **Marketing & Sales division** Looks for unique selling points catered towards user needs, product efficiency, and product simplicity.
- **Retailers** Able to cater the product to a wide range of audiences for multiple solutions. 


## Use Cases

**User Case #1:**
In a typical home environment, an individual entering a room with their hands full can easily activate the lights by using audio commands. The light system picks up on the auditory signal, and turns the lights in the room on in response. This eliminates the need to physically find and flip a switch, which provides convenience to users, especially if their hands are full.

**User Case #2:**
Large, dark rooms, such as basements or other storage areas, can pose hazards to individuals walking through them, as obstacles or uneven flooring may get in the way. Users can activate the light with the auditory commands, eliminating the risk of tripping or causing other accidents in such kinds of potentially hazardous environments.

## Aspects

The new product design will be based on that of the AirPods with improvements based on the following requirements. The **P1 - P10** is the "code" to indicate the priority of the requirement, from low to high.

1. **Producr Design**
   * 1.1 The product shall be visually easy to distinguish from existing AirPods as well as main competitors Sony WF-1000XM3, Jabra Elite, Amazon Echo Buds, Samsung Galaxy Buds, and Bose SoundSport Free, and Urbanista Stockholm. (P10)
   * 1.1 The product shall be easy to recognize as an Apple product without needing a logo on its exterior. (P10)
   * 1.2. The product shall avoid styling elements from our Powerbeats over-ear wireless headphones since those address a different market segment. (P8)
  
1. **Functionality**
      * 2.1 The product shall incorporate one or more optical proximity sensors to detect the user wearing it. (P10)
      * 2.2 The product shall offer a dual microphone in each earbud. (P10)

## Requirement Criteria Specifications

* 1.1.1 - Regulate system power from 9 volts to 5 volts
* 1.1.2 - Provide over-amperage project to not exceed 1.5 amps.

## Open Questions

* Can we move towards a recyclable and repairable product, for example, with ZIF connectors and glue-free assembly?
* Can we improve on failing or self-igniting batteries?
