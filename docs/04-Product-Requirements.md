## Project Objective

This project aims to develop a sound-actuated automatic lighting system that will respond to specific audio cues to turn lights on and off. Using audio detection will create a convenient hands-free experience for users, allowing for more enhanced lighting across various environments, such as homes, offices, and other workspaces. By using a sound-responsive system, the project will improve energy efficiency while maintaining effectiveness and simplicity. It will be designed to be easy to install and interact with, allowing users with limited technical experience to operate and benefit from the product.

## Stakeholders

- **Target group** Individuals in environments where hands-free lighting solutions would improve accessibility and convenience.
- **Target purchaser** Organizations or individuals wanting practical, energy efficient lighting solutions that will enhance user experience.
- **Customer service** Provides straightforward and timely responses to support troubleshooting solutions to users
- **Marketing & Sales division** Looks for unique selling points catered towards user needs, product efficiency, and product simplicity.
- **Retailers** Able to cater the product to a wide range of audiences for multiple solutions. 


## Use Cases

**User Case #1:**
In a typical home environment, an individual entering a room with their hands full can easily activate the lights by using audio commands. The light system picks up on the auditory signal, and turns the lights in the room on in response. This eliminates the need to physically find and flip a switch, which provides convenience to users, especially if their hands are full.

**User Case #2:**
Large, dark rooms, such as basements or other storage areas, can pose hazards to individuals walking through them, as obstacles or uneven flooring may get in the way. Users can activate the light with the auditory commands, eliminating the risk of tripping or causing other accidents in such kinds of potentially hazardous environments.

## Aspects

The new product design will be based on that of typical sound-activated automatic lighting systems with improvements based on the following requirements. The **P1 - P10** is the "code" to indicate the priority of the requirement, from low to high.

1. **Product Design**

   * 1.1 The product shall be visually easy to distinguish from existing lighting systems as well as main competitors which can be various motion activated lights that are battery powered. (P10)
   * 1.2 The product shall be easy to recognize as a high quality and highly practical lighting solution given its many was to mount it on a wide range of surfaces. (P10)
   * 1.3 The product shall avoid styling elements from our other lighting solutions such as the thin exterior plastic that often makes the product feel very cheap. (P8)
   * 1.4 The product shall have simple design with having mechanical buttons while keeping the various mounting solutions on the back of the product. (P8)
  
1. **Functionality**

       * 2.1 The product shall incorporate external buttons for immediate controll. (P10)
       * 2.2 The product shall offer a microphone looking for specific audio inputs to tricker the light. (P10)
       * 2.3 The product shall have a customizable mounting system to accommodate various mounting systems. (P9)
       * 2.4 The product shall have a rechargeable battery system. (P10)
       * 2.5 The product shall turn off after a set period which can be adjusted by the user. (P5)



## Requirement Criteria Specifications

* 1.1.1 - Utalize Type-C charging for universal use with an onboard power regulator to 5.0 V.
* 1.1.2 - Rechargable lithim ion battery with a minimum capacity of 10,000 mHa.
* 1.1.3 - Tactile pull buttons, with clear graphics demontrating what the buttons are used for.
* 1.2.1 - Built in magnets on adjustable "legs" of the product.
* 1.2.2 - Various adaptors for mounting to different surfaces.  

## Open Questions

* Can we move towards a recyclable and repairable product, for example, with ZIF connectors and glue-free assembly?
* Can we improve on lighting a room from a single sorce?
* Can we create a cost effective product that is also practical and durable?
