Reflection

Lessons Learned: As a team we quickly learened how to work together and finish eachothers work due to our diffirent schedules. As a team we learned how to systematicly sepreate tasks to share am,on the team because we did not feel it nessisary to lock our selves in roles that would unequally distrubute the work load. Together we reflected on class time to make game plans inorder to meet deadlines for this couse. We also would text in a group chat incase situations came up or to give status updates on where each teammmeber was at so we are all on the same page. 

## Recommendations for future students:

Create a numbered list with the top five recommendations for future students of what they should learn or do to prepare themselves for taking this class. Each item must be at least one complete sentence long.

1. Always look at the labs in advance and give yourself plenty of time to build and troubleshoot the circuits before bringing them to class.
2. Read assignment instrcutions carefully so you dont forget to include anything. Making checklists of every single thing required may be benefical to keep track of what has or has not yet been done.

3. If you have the time revist past assignemnts do it and make sure your work is what was expected. So much of this course builds off of previous assignemnts. Do not let the first round of grading make false expectations, often on the second pass you and the grading team will do, both will find mistakes, so try your best to revist your work and amend anything that was missed the first time.
