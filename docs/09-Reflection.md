## Lessons Learned

As a team we quickly learned how to work together and finish each other's work due to our different schedules. As a team we learned how to systematically separate tasks to share am,on the team because we did not feel it necessary to lock ourselves in roles that would unequally distribute the work load. Together we reflected on class time to make game plans in order to meet deadlines for this course. We also would text in a group chat in case situations came up or to give status updates on where each team member was at so we are all on the same page. Often, we would break down assignments into smaller, more manageable parts in order to complete assignments as thoroughly and comprehensively as possible. From the design review feedback, we learned how important clear documentation, communication, and diagrams are, especially when presenting our work to others who may not know the details of our system. Clear documentation makes it easier to debug and review errors because it lets us quickly backtrack through our design decisions and iterations, identify exactly where problems originated, and make changes without disrupting other parts of the system. 

## Recommendations for future students:

Create a numbered list with the top five recommendations for future students of what they should learn or do to prepare themselves for taking this class. Each item must be at least one complete sentence long.

1. Always look at the labs in advance and give yourself plenty of time to build and troubleshoot the circuits before bringing them to class.
2. Read assignment instrcutions carefully so you dont forget to include anything. Making checklists of every single thing required may be benefical to keep track of what has or has not yet been done.

3. If you have the time revist past assignemnts do it and make sure your work is what was expected. So much of this course builds off of previous assignemnts. Do not let the first round of grading make false expectations, often on the second pass you and the grading team will do, both will find mistakes, so try your best to revist your work and amend anything that was missed the first time.
