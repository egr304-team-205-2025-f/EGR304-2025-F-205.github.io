## Intro/overview

This phase of our product design focused on developing a wide range of features that could be added to our product in order to best meet the previously identified user needs and product requirements. Through structured brainstorming, idea organization, and concept development, we were able to produce three distinct product concepts.

To move forward with our project, we selected the most important ideas from our initial design concepts and combined them into a comprehensive product. We considered key design requirements, including hands-free operation, energy efficiency, and user-friendliness. We selected what we determined to be key aspects of each design and combined them into one final product. This approach allowed us to create a hybrid design that balances practicality, convenience, and innovation.


During the ideation phase, our concepts focused primarily on motion and sound based activation for hands-free operation. After further consideration, we decided to enhance the system’s responsiveness by emphasizing the integration an audio sensor to detect specific sounds, such as clapping, for turning the light on and off. The sensors will spin when idle, and then stop moving once the light is turned on. This update deviates from the initial concepts by combining brightness and sound detection to create a more versatile and user-friendly system. The decision was guided by our goal to simplify daily interactions, improve accessibility, and increase automation, while maintaining compactness, energy efficiency, and overall system reliability.
