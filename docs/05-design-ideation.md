## Intro/overview

This phase of our product design focused on developing a wide range of features that could be added to our product in order to best meet the previously identified user needs and product requirements. Through structured brainstorming, idea organization, and concept development, we were able to produce three distinct product concepts.

## Generating Ideas

For each user need and product requirement, brainstorm 5 different product features that could be used to satisfy that requirement.
