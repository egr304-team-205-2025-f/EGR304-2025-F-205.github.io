## Generating Ideas

For each user need and product requirement, brainstorm 5 different product features that could be used to satisfy that requirement.

|                   requirement / need |             feature              | detail                                                                      |
| -----------------------------------: | :------------------------------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Product has different brightness settings |              adjustable brightness setting              | Device has manual settings (button) to allow users to cycle through preset brightness levels |
| Product has different brightness settings |             light sensor              | Device automatically adjusts brightness based on surrounding light conditions                                          |
| Product has different brightness settings |              touch screen display              | Device uses a digital interface to conrtol brightness |
| Product has different brightness settings |              memory function              | Device remembers and resumes last used brightness setting |
| Product has different brightness settings |              auto dimming              | Device gradually dims after prolonged use |
| Multiple units function simultaneously with each other |              wireless syncronization              | Units can automatically sync to operate together |
| Multiple units function simultaneously with each other |              app control              | Device operates with an app interface to control them as one |
| Multiple units function simultaneously with each other |              main unit              | One unit acts as the main one through which behavior of connected units is controlled |
| Multiple units function simultaneously with each other |              signal relay              | Units can relay signals to others |
| Multiple units function simultaneously with each other |              remote controlled              | Units can be controlled by a physical remote control when synced |
| Product has long lasting battery |              high capacity battery              | Uses a high capacity battery to hold charge for longer |
| Product has long lasting battery |              low power mode              | Device enters low energy state when not in active use |
| Product has long lasting battery |              power saving  components              | Uses low energy components like LEDS to conserve energy |
| Product has long lasting battery |              battery health display              | Device uses lights to show battery state of product |
| Product has long lasting battery |              solar charging              | Device can recharge/remain powered by sunlight when not in use |
| Product is portable |              handle/clip              | Device has a handle or clip to easily transport it |
| Product is portable |              swappale batteries              | Device is battery powered to minimize components needed to use it |
