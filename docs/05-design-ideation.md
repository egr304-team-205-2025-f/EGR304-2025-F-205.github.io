## Intro/overview

This phase of our product design focused on developing a wide range of features that could be added to our product in order to best meet the previously identified user needs and product requirements. Through structured brainstorming, idea organization, and concept development, we were able to produce three distinct product concepts.

To move forward with our project, we selected the most important ideas from our initial design concepts and combined them into a comprehensive product. We considered key design requirements, including hands-free operation, durability, energy efficiency, and user-friendliness. From our concepts, we retained motion sensing and compactness, and enhanced functionality by adding audio detection to automatically turn the light on and off. This approach allowed us to create a hybrid design that balances practicality, convenience, and innovation.


During the ideation phase, our concepts focused primarily on motion-based activation for hands-free operation. After further consideration, we decided to enhance the system’s responsiveness by adding an audio sensor to detect specific sounds, such as clapping, for turning the light on and off. This update deviates from the initial concepts by combining motion and sound detection to create a more versatile and user-friendly system. The decision was guided by our goal to simplify daily interactions, improve accessibility, and increase automation, while maintaining compactness, energy efficiency, and overall system reliability.
