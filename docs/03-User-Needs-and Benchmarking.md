| "I am a STEM teacher and bought a large quantity of these kits and I am disgusted by how easily the motor breaks. 12 years in STEM schools and this product is at the bottom of my list. The ladybug platform, as we call it, needs some reimagining and the materials simply can't handle the wear and tear of a classroom. Sad that I spend my own money on this with so little we got out of it." | 1.  The kit is robust. (explicit)                       |
