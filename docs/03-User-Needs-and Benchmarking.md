| "This is such a helpful light! The selector slide on the bottom has 3 positions: ON, OFF, & AUTO. On the "AUTO" setting, the light is triggered by its built in motion sensor and stays on for just over 20 seconds. If you choose the "On" setting, you can use it as a flashlight. It has 5 different light hues that you can select by touching the power button. It comes with a 3M double sided adhesive that you can apply to the round magnetic mount. The magnet is strong enough to hold the light vertically or horizontally. It also comes with a 4' USB C cable. I mounted it in our closet doorway behind the folding doors. The light triggers once my hand reaches in. Twenty seconds is plenty of time for me to select a shirt at 5AM without turning on the overhead and light and waking my beloved. No more fumbling for my cell or watch flashlight. Best of all, since it turns itself "ON" & "OFF", I have two free hands to complete tasks with. Hurray!!!" | 1.

It also has a feature where it is motion activated so would be great as a night light that can be installed anywhere or as an emergency light as long as you make sure it is charged up from time to time. This light came with easy to follow instructions, a power cord, a base that the light magnetically attaches to and an adhesive pad. It was fully charged within 3 hours and works great! Some things to note: I don't think it would fare well if dropped so it should be handled with care. It doesn't come with the plug portion to charge it so you'll need to make sure you have a 5V1A block charger on hand." | 1. Adjustable lighting (explicit) |

| "This light has potential but lacks quality control as far as production and design. First, the negatives were the poorly thought out way of hanging this light, a 3M double piece of tape, and a cheaply made plastic mount with 2 tiny magnets. When I opened mine, the magnet on the light had already fallen off, so without gluing it back on, there was no other way to hang it. The magnet not being secured properly is a very real hazard to be swallowed by a child The good points are I like the motion sensor it works very well,the ability to change the color tone makes it good for use in many situations and being rechargeable and the use of USB C is nice. I cannot recommend this product to friends and family it is just to much of a hazard to children." | 1.  Product could use stronger, more durable structure (explicit)                       |

Safty concerns with sizing of components (explicit) |

Potential damaging of the product during transportation (latent)           |
| "Does automatically switch on when it detects a movement, and will shut off after a minute. it does illuminate the area needed. i have this in the A/C closet because the lighting is bad, and I figured that a flashlight there that came on automatically would be nice. however, it does not hold a charge a long time. After a week, the unit was dead and needed to be recharged again. I tried this for three weeks and after about 7 days the unit is dead. then it needs to be recharged. I have another light that uses AA batteries and it has stayed active for over a year. disappointed." | 1. Needs to hold charge for long periods (explicit) |
| | 2. Needs to be more convenient than market competetors (explicit) |
| | 3. Can be used in abstract areas (implicit) |
| "I have had this up in a small closet that does not have a light for about 2 weeks. First the actual light itself is great. Second, the small magnetic unit that it is supposed to cling to fell off the wall inside that 2 weeks. Third, every time I pick up the light to use it I end up changing the setting. It has 5 light settings. So using this as a "wand" just annoys me. I will figure out something to keep it attached to the wall. The small magnetic strip keeps the light on the mount, just the mount doesn't stay on the wall. Now when I get it to stay on the wall, the light is bright enough to see inside this small closet. So, not horrible, just not great." | 1. Can be practical enough to replace existing lights (implicit) |
| | 2. Device settings should not change unwantingly (explicit) |
| | 3. All device components should have a long usability life-cycle (implicit) |
