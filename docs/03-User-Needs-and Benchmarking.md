| "The motion detection works really well and the brightness is perfect for the half bathroom I installed it in. What really made this great is that it stays on for about five minutes. Other lights went off too quick, and I was so sick of installing another pull chain on the light fixture. This was a great solution. I am going to order another and put it in the other half bath." | 1.  Reliable motion detection that activates the light effectively. (explicit)                             |

Longer auto-off timer to avoid frequent reactivation or using pull chains. (explicit)                               | "Detects motion and turns on as soon as I open the door to the hall stair way which is nice. It stays on for longer than most motion sensing lights (5 minutes after it has stopped sensing motion) its up to personal preference if that is a good amount of time or not. For me its a fair bit longer than I need. Cant speak to longevity as yet, but it works better than some of the "unknown brands" I have found on Amazon." | 1.
