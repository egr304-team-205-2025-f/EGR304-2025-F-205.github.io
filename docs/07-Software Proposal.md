## Introduction

As seen in figure #1 this page is dedicated to demonstrate how we propose our code. We plan on using the sensor boards to read their respective sensors and to then send a determined value to the central board. Within the central board there are user input controls that will also affect the Light board along with the information gathered from the sensor boards. Once the central board determines the input it will send a corasponding response to the Light board. As the Light board recives the information it will output on to the LEDs depending on the information that the board is being sent.

## Conclusions and Future Work

In conclusion to our reaserch and project development we believe we have designed a product that has meet our inital product requirements. This also complies with the requriments set up by our EGR 304 class.
