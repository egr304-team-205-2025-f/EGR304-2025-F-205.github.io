## Team Charter

Our team is working to develop a solution that simplifies daily actions through a smart, hands-free lighting system. By integrating a combination of sound and brightness detection, we aim to remove the need for manual light control, making everyday interactions more convenient and efficient for users. Through this project, we seek to strengthen our PCB design skills while delivering a safe and reliable product. Success for our team means creating a professional, working prototype that demonstrates our ability to use automation to improve daily life.


## Product Mission Statement

The goal of our product is to deliver a smart, hands-free lighting solution that enhances daily convenience through simple and reliable automation. The system uses sound and brightness sensors to detect user presence and environmental cues, sending signals to a control board that activates lighting without the need for physical interaction.
