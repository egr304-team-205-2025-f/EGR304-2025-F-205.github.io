## Progress Documentation



Our brainstorming session was set up to generate a wide range of feature ideas based on user needs and product requirements. The point of generating so many feature ideas was to be able to later group these features so that three distinct product concepts could be produced.

Most group members participated in the brainstorming process. The process was conducted asynchronously via a group chat so that team members could keep up with each other's progress and ideas. Once all 100 features were generated, a team member organized and sorted them into different categories. 

Our feature ideas were primarily based on the user needs that were generated and organized in the User Needs and Benchmarking assignment. The results from this assignment helped ensure that our brainstorming and the features that were generated from it remained centered around the needs we had previously identified. The existing products and their reviews helped guide our brainstorming and later helped us create three distinct product concepts.

Features were categorized based on the user needs they addressed. Within each group, we identified the top features that would best fit the main requirement of each group. We also included supporting features that would help enhance the overall user experience and functionality of the project. Additionally, combinations of features were explored, which could contribute to product subsections within its system. Each group followed this structure, allowing us to envision how the features we generated could come together into cohesive product concepts. 

These now grouped features were ranked based on how important they were to fulfilling our previously mentioned user needs. These needs were similarly ranked, and the top-ranked features were then recombined into three distinct product concepts, with unused features saved in a separate location for documentation and possible future reference. Each product concept emphasized different features to see which combinations of them would best optimize user needs and functionality. This process helped us balance creativity with structure, ensuring that our final concepts were innovative while remaining user-driven.
