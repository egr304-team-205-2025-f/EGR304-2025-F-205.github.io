## Communication Channels & Procedures

Below is a table displayed the team's preffered communication methods.
| **Name**        | **First Choice Communication** | **Second Choice Communication** | **Third Choice Communication** |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Dario Solis Alvarez    | Instagram Group Chat    | Text                            | Call                           |
| Sam Burns              | ??? | | ??? | | ??? |
| Arianna Lazaritt       | Instagram group chat | | Text | | Email |
| Sam Mangus             | ??? | | ??? | | ??? |


Our team will primarily communicate via a group chat on Instagram. This allows for asynchronous discussion and is convenient for quick check-ins, reminders, and general coordination. ???? will be responsible for all instructor correspondence. This includes sending emails in terms of group-specific questions, and any responses or feedback will be relayed back to the team group chat by the end of the day.
For project documents and collaborative work, we will use Google Docs to ensure that all work is easily accessible and organized.

## Meeting Schedule & Coordination


## Roles & Responsibilities


## Team Coordination & Accountability
To ensure timely submissions, our team will set internal deadlines at least 4 hours before official due dates. Before any assignment is submitted, each team member will review the final version and give a verbal or written “ok” to submit. 

To ensure everyone has the required knowledge and skills, we will assess our strengths before beginning major tasks.Task responsibilities will be decided based on knowledge and skill level, as well as individual confidence that some can complete their assigned task. If a member needs support, they can reach out to the rest of the team to get the necessary support to complete the task.

Design review feedback will be documented and shared with the whole team. Tasks will then be assigned and distributed among team members to make sure all feedback is addressed. We'll confirm updates are completed as a group before moving forward.

If a member misses a contribution or falls behind, we will start with a private conversation to address the situation. If the issue continues, it will be discussed as a team and documented. If there's no improvement despite these efforts, we may escalate the issue to an instructor, depending on the severity of the issue. Throughout the project, we will hold each other accountable through regular check-ins, and open communication.

## Conflict Recognition & Resolution
Our team understands that conflict is a common aspect of collaboration. Instead of avoiding disagreements, we will recognize and address them openly and respectfully. 

In order to prevent unnecessary conflict, we will establish clear roles and responsibilities from the beginning and do regular check-ins to ensure tasks are balanced. This will help avoid conflicts of interest, which often occur when one person takes on too much or when responsibilities are not clearly defined.

If conflict arises, we will first try to resolve it within the team by discussing the issue among ourselves. Conflicts will be escalated if a team member is consistently unresponsive or failing to meet responsibilities. If the conflict is so severe that it begins to impact the project’s progress, will we escalate the issue to the instructor. In such cases, our designated point of contact will provide a clear summary of the situation and what we’ve already done to try to resolve it.
