Our team will primarily communicate via a group chat on Instagram. This allows for asynchronous discussion and is convenient for quick check-ins, reminders, and general coordination. ???? will be responsible for all instructor correspondence. This includes sending emails in terms of group-specific questions, and any responses or feedback will be relayed back to the team group chat (in what time line????).
For project documents and collaborative work, we will use Google Docs to ensure that all work is easily accessible and organized.
